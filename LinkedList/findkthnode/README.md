**Objective**: The goal is to find the kth node from the end of a linked list.

**Approach**:

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - We start by initializing two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.

2. **Advance the Fast Pointer**:
   - The `fast` pointer is moved `k` steps ahead. This creates a gap of `k` nodes between `fast` and `slow`.

3. **Move Both Pointers Together**:
   - While the `fast` pointer is not at the end of the list:
     - Move both `fast` and `slow` one node at a time.

4. **Result**:
   - When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be pointing to the kth node from the end.

**Explanation**:

- The idea behind this algorithm is to use two pointers to traverse the linked list.
- The `fast` pointer moves ahead by `k` nodes first, creating a gap between the two pointers.
- Then, both `fast` and `slow` move forward one node at a time. This way, the gap between them is maintained at `k` nodes.
- When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the kth node from the end.

**Efficiency**:

- This algorithm is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the linked list, making it a linear time complexity solution.
- It's particularly useful when you don't know the length of the linked list in advance.

**Special Cases**:

- If `k` is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in the list, the algorithm may return `null` or handle it as specified in the problem statement. This is because there won't be a kth node from the end in such cases.
