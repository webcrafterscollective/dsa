# Essential Data structures and Algorithms 
This repository provides comprehensive implementations of essential data structures and algorithms in both Python and JavaScript. It serves as a valuable resource for learning, practicing, and reviewing key concepts in computer science. Additionally, the repository includes a curated selection of interview questions to help you prepare for technical interviews.
